    <b><font size="4">Denver Health Lawson Portal Login Help</font></b>

		<p>If you are using Self Service for the first time, your user ID is your initials in lowercase letters followed by your employee number.  Your password is your initials in lowercase and the last six digits of your social security number.</p>

		<p>For example, if <b>John Doe's</b> employee number is <b>12345</b> and his social security number is <b>987-65-4321</b>, his user ID is <b>jd12345</b> and his password is <b>jd654321</b>.</p>

		<p><font color=red><b>If you do not know your user ID or password, please contact the Customer Support Center using the phone number below :</b></p>

			<blockquote>
			<p><b><font color = black><font size = "6">1-855-555-5555 (1-855-555-5555)</b></p>

			</blockquote>
		</font>

		<p>When entered incorrectly, the ID and password text boxes turn yellow.  After five attempts, your user ID will be locked (you will see a blue screen) and you will need to contact the Customer Support Center.</p>
