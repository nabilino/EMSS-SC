		<P><B>Important:  </B> To enroll in St. Luke’s Healthy U and qualify for ANY health plan premium reductions, you AND/OR your dependent spouse must complete two easy steps within 30 days of your date of hire or transfer to a benefits eligible status (date of hire or transfer is day 1).</P>
		<P><b><u>Step 1:</u>  Complete a Know Your Numbers (KYN) Screening. </b><br>
			The KYN Screening consists of biometric measures such as blood pressure, height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, nicotine screen and fasting blood glucose. Those with diabetes need to provide an A1c lab result within 6 months of hire date.</p>
			<p>New employees receive the KYN Screening as part of the on-boarding process. Spouses can complete the screening at St. Luke’s or submit a <a href="/lawson/xbnnet/plandescriptions/HUScreeningVerificationForm.pdf" target="_new">Healthcare Provider Verification Form</a> if they have had a physical exam within 6 months of hire date. Note: spouses will still need to drop-in at St. Luke’s to complete the nicotine screen. Check the <A HREF="http://inside.slrmc.org/healthyu/" TARGET="_blank">St. Luke’s Healthy U</a> website for locations on your campus.</p>
