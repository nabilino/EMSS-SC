	<p align="left">Flexible Spending is an annual benefit election. If you 
	participated in Plan Year 2010/2011 and you wish to continue, you must elect 
	again for Plan Year 2011/2012. </p>
	<p align="left">This is a “<b>Use it or Lose it</b>” plan. At the end of the 
	Plan Year, if there is any money left in your FSA that you are not able 
	claim for services completed within the Plan Year, you will forfeit any amount remaining in your account. You have 90 days after the end of the plan year to submit claims, 
	provided the dates of service for those claims fall within the plan year.
	</p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">Each account is completely separate: For example, you cannot 
	use funds from the Dependent Care FSA to pay for your 
	children’s medical expenses. </p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">Elections are irrevocable unless you submit the appropriate 
	paperwork to Benefits Services within 30 days of a qualified change in 
	status. Please note: The change you make to your FSA election must be 
	consistent with the qualifying event. For example, if your qualifying event 
	is the birth of a new baby, you can only increase (not decrease) the amount 
	of your annual FSA election. </p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">If you currently have direct deposit with your FSA, you do 
	not need to resubmit the direct deposit information.  If you would like to have direct deposit for your FSA reimbursements, you must complete 
	a <a HREF="/lawson/xbnnet/plandescriptions/DirectDeposit.pdf" TARGET="_blank">Direct Deposit form</a>, attach a voided check and send it to Benefit 
	Services.  If you do not want direct deposit, you will receive paper 
	checks for your reimbursement.</p>
