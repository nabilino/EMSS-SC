	<p align="left">Flexible Spending is an annual benefit election. If you 
	participated in Plan Year 2007/2008 and you wish to continue, you must elect 
	again for Plan Year 2008/2009. </p>
	<p align="left">This is a “<b>Use it or Lose it</b>” plan. At the end of the 
	Plan Year, if there is any money left in your FSA that you are not able 
	claim for services completed within the Plan Year, you will lose the unspent 
	money. You have 90 days after the end of the plan year to submit claims, 
	provided the dates of service for those claims fall within the plan year.
	</p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">Each account is completely separate: For example, you cannot 
	use funds from the Dependent Care Assistance Account to pay for your 
	children’s medical expenses. </p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">Elections are irrevocable unless you submit the appropriate 
	paperwork to the Benefits Department within 60 days of a qualified change in 
	status. Please note: The change you make to your FSA election must be 
	consistent with the qualifying event. For example, if your qualifying event 
	is the birth of a new baby, you can only increase (not decrease) the amount 
	of your annual Health Care Account election. </p>
	<center><center>
	<p align="left">If you wish to elect direct deposit for your FSA election, 
	and do not already have this information on file with Pinnacle Pension 
	services, you must complete a direct deposit form, attach a voided check and 
	send it into the Benefits Department. This form is located on the “<b>home 
	page</b>” under “<b>forms.</b>” Your current election will continue unless 
	Pinnacle Pension Services are contacted to change it. </p>
