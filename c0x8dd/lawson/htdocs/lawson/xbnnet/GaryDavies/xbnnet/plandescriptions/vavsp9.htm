		      	<P>Your PTO balance will decrease by the same number of hours I have elected to sellback at the appropriate time. You will not be allowed to change this election due to I.R.S. guidelines. </P>
		      	<P>You have completed at least 90 days of employment as of March 29, 2008, and have at least 120 hours of PTO.  If you do not meet this requirement, you will not be notified by the Benefits Department and your election will be void. </P>
		      	<P>At sellback time, due to reasons beyond my control, I have accrued less or have less hours available than what I have contracted here, I will be contacted by the Benefits Department to inform me of the actual hours that will sellback. </P>
		      	<P>I understand that if I have elected participation in the 403(b) plan that any eligible contributions will be deducted from my PTO Sellback payout. In addition, you will receive eligible employer matching contributions. </P>
		      	<P>The amount to be sold back must be from those hours accrued in the year in which sellback occurs. For example, if you elect to sell back 40 hours in October, you must accrue 40 hours between pay periods 8-20 of 2008. Sellback hours will be paid out at your base salary in effect at the time of each sellback period and sellback hours will be taxed at the higher supplemental wage rate as required by IRS regulations. Differentials are not included. Similarly, you must maintain a PTO balance below 320 hours in order to accrue PTO to sell back. </P></td>
