					<td>It is mandatory that if you have direct deposit, you do not receive a paper paystub.  This policy saves St. Luke's $69,000.00 per year.  Remember, you can always print an online paystub too.  If this is still an issue, we would like to hear why you want to receive a paper paystub, because it might allow us to understand an issue with our system, so please feel free to contact Payroll by finding their number on the Contacts link under the myHR Payroll section on the left side of the Portal.</td>

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr vAlign="top" align="left" bgColor="#eaeaea">
					<td>A:</td>
					<td>
            <p>This is because a couple of non-cash deductions included on the paper paystubs and were grouped into the Total Deductions category.</p>
            <p>Examples of these are the Excess Group Term Life (shows up as Ex Life under Wages on paper paystub), and the ING Retirement Company Match (shows as ING Mat under Taxes/Deductions on paper paystub).</p>
            <p><b>For Excess Group Term Life:</b> We're required by the Federal government to tax an employee who makes over $50,000 annually based on age, life expectancy, etc.  The Federal government provides  a formula by which to accomplish this task.  Each payroll a calculated amount is added to the employee's wages, taxed, and then taken out as a deduction.  The result is the tax paid on the excess group term life.  In most cases, this amount is very minimal.  Since the excess group term life is a non-cash earning, it is listed in the earning section but not the deduction section.  It is, unfortunately included in the total of all deductions.</p>
            <p><b>For ING 403(b) Retirement Company Match:</b> This is the amount contributed by St. Luke's towards your retirement, which is a company match based on your current retirement elections.  This contribution goes directly into your ING Retirement account from St. Luke's, and is in addition to the ING 403(b) retirement amount you have elected to put into your 403(b) account from your pay check.  Since we list this on the paper paystub to let you know that we are contributing it at no cost to you, we list it as a deduction.  Then it unfortunately gets grouped into the Total Deduction category even though its not a deduction out of your paycheck, it comes directly from St. Luke's separate from your salary.</p>

					<td>A:</td>
					<td>A company deduction is some dollar amount contributed by St. Luke's as a consequence of you being enrolled in a benefit or retirement plan.  For example, even though you might pay every pay period for Dental Insurance, St. Luke's also pays a certain amount to help you get your Dental coverage.  This is to allow your benefit costs to be lower.  You may also notice that St. Luke's will contribute a certain dollar amount to your 403b plan through a Company Match.  This money goes directly into your Retirement account in addition to your retirement contributions from your pay check.</td>
