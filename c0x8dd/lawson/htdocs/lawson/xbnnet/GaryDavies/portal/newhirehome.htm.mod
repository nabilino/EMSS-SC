This enrollment period gives you the opportunity to establish your benefits
elections for the remainder of the current plan year.</p>
<P align="left">
Upon completion of the on-line enrollment process, you will have the 
ability to print a confirmation statement of your benefit elections.  You have only one opportunity to save your elected benefits in online new hire enrollment.  However, if you choose to not save your benefits elections by selecting "Exit and make elections later", you will be able to go through enrollment again.  If you do save your benefits elections, but have changed your mind and you are still within 30 days from your day of hire, you may fill out the paper forms and deliver them to Benefits Services.</p>
<p>Also available are the summary
plan descriptions for each of the benefit plans.  The Benefits Highlights booklet 
is also available for you to review. This booklet summarizes all of the different benefits plans available to elect. If you do not complete your new hire enrollment, you will not have any coverage until a qualifying life event or during annual open enrollment period for the new plan year starting April 1. </p>

link for the appropriate phone number.)   <B>Happy Enrolling!</B>
